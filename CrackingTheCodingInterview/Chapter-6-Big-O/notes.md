#DEFINITION#
Big O is a language used to describe efficiency/time complexity of data structure algorithms. It can be used to predict if an algorithm is fast or slow at best, average, and worst cases.

#Types of Time Complexity or runtime#

##O(1) Constant##
Constant time complexity with respect to the size or number of items. 
Ex: It will take the same amount time to send a large or small chunk of files over to someone. It will take the same amount of time to manipulate an array with 100,000 elements or 10 elements.

##O(n) Linear##
Linear time complexity with respect to the size or number of items.
Ex: It will take double the amount of time to manipulate twice amount of information.

*Regardless of how big the constant is or how slow the linear is, O(n)'s slope will surpass constant, in which more information will take more time to process in the O(n) case compared to O(1).

##O(log(n)) Logarithmic##
Logarithmic time complexity with respect to size or number of items. 
There isn't much of a difference in time as size increases, time increases in a non-linear, and much slower/steader rate towards the end(almost like a constant and linear). 
Ex: Binary Search Trees are used in this matter because



#Space Complexity#
Similar to Time Complexity, it evaluates how much space or memory is required by an algorithm.
Ex: An array with size of n will require O(n) of space, where as a two-dimensional array of size nxn will require O(n^2) space.
